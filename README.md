# Ph.D. Tools

This repository contains the code for various tools I used during my doctoral degree. These tools are:

- [x] A template for creating publication-style figures ([Plotting](https://github.com/KOrfanakis/PhD_Tools/tree/main/Plotting)),
- [x] [Curve Fitting](https://github.com/KOrfanakis/PhD_Tools/tree/main/Curve%20Fitting), and
- [x] [Making GIFs](https://github.com/KOrfanakis/PhD_Tools/tree/main/Making%20GIFs).

All three tutorials are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and are presented as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
